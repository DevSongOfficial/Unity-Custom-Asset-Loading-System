### Simple Resource Loader
**ResourceLoader** scans folders and all types of resources in **Resources** folder and then generates a C# script that contains structs and enums based on it.

With this, you can load resources simply by calling the **ResourceLoader** after a single drag'n drop into your **Resources** folder:
```Unity
Instantiate(ResourceLoader.GetResource<GameObject>(Prefabs.UI.SpawnButton_1));
SetMaterial(ResourceLoader.GetResource<Material>(Materials.Tree_1));
```

This is designed specifically for my simple projects.
- Compared to **Asset Bundle** or **Addressable**, this is more suitable for personal learning projects.
- I made this in order to streamline the process of loading assets.
- You can see the whole code from my [RTS project](https://github.com/DevSongOfficial/Real-Time-Strategy).

#

### How To Use
1. Place any resources you want to access at runtime through ResourceLoader.cs into your **Resources** folder.
2. Open the editor window(Window -> Custom Asset Window) and drag'n drop your script that you want to add enums to.

4. Based on your folder structure, After clicking **Save** Button in the editor window, your script will automatically be edited with corresponding enums inside.
5. Now you can load your resources by calling `ResourceLoader.GetResource<T>(Enum enumMember);`

### Example
<img width="120" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78323ceb-485c-4e59-ab8d-2e85dfb69088" />
would look like this:

```Unity
// This script's automatically generated by EnumGenerator.cs
namespace CustomResourceManagement
{
  public enum Materials{
    Tree_1,
    Tree_2,
  }
  public struct Prefabs{
    public struct Playable{
      public enum Unit{
        Wizard,
        Gladiator,
        Dragon,
      }
  }
    public enum UI{
      SpawnButton_1,
    }
  }
  public struct Textures{
    public enum UI{
      Health,
    }
  }
}

```
